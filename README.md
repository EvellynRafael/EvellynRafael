## Hey! ðŸ‘‹


I am a Developer with over three years of experience, specializing in Web and Mobile Development, Software Engineering, and Microsoft Solutions. I am proficient in technologies such as React.JS, Node.JS, MySQL, TypeScript, and React Native. Currently, I am expanding my expertise in mobile development by studying Flutter.

- Throughout my career, I have developed software and web pages using React.JS, Axios, Redux, Material-UI, React Hook Form, and Tailwind for the front end, and Node.JS, Express, and MySQL for the back end. Additionally, I contributed to the creation of an AI-powered robot in Python to automate data verification processes.

- I have assisted in developing mobile applications with React Native, later transitioning to Native Android development with Java. I also applied my knowledge of Flutter to create a small quiz app for the company I worked for.

- I integrated systems with ERP TOTVS RM using APIs and Webservices with SoapUI, automating and streamlining processes within the ERP by connecting it to software developed in React.

- I created Virtual Reality projects, modeling 3D objects in Blender and designing games in Unreal Engine 5 using Blueprints and C#.

- I have developed solutions using Microsoft tools such as SharePoint, Power Pages, and Power Apps. My work also includes data analysis, dashboard creation with Power BI, and automation with Power Automate.

- Furthermore, I have participated in 24-hour project development competitions, having had the privilege of being part of a winning team. I also served as an interpreter during an academic exchange program and have consistently volunteered in various social projects.

Passionate about creating interactive and functional experiences, I am constantly enhancing my skills and exploring new technologies to deliver innovative and high-quality software solutions. I am a dedicated and proactive professional, always ready to embrace new challenges in the fields of development and innovation.
